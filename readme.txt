The Excel workbooks in this repository are self-contained problem sets for practicing the principles of health policy modeling in Excel. They were originally developed for MS&E 92 - Intro to Health Policy Modeling during Summer 2019 at Stanford University.

Please email me (altonr@stanford.edu) for the solutions if you are an instructor wishing to use these for your own class. Also let me know if you find any errors.
